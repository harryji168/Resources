## Jest
 
 Jest[1] is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook, Inc. designed and built by Christoph Nakazawa with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications. It works with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Angular, Vue.js and Svelte. Jest does not require a lot of configuration for first time users of a testing framework.
