Within project management, scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining products in a complex environment,[1] with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies.[2] It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The scrum team assess progress in time-boxed daily meetings of 15 minutes or less, called daily scrums (a form of stand-up meeting). At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: the sprint review which demonstrates the work done to stakeholders to elicit feedback, and sprint retrospective which enables the team to reflect and improve.
