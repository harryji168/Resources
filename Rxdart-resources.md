# RxDart  
 
 RxDart extends the capabilities of Dart Streams and StreamControllers.

Dart comes with a very decent Streams API out-of-the-box; rather than attempting to provide an alternative to this API, RxDart adds functionality from the reactive extensions specification on top of it.

RxDart does not provide its Observable class as a replacement for Dart Streams. Instead, it offers several additional Stream classes, operators (extension methods on the Stream class), and Subjects.

If you are familiar with Observables from other languages, please see the Rx Observables vs. Dart Streams comparison chart for notable distinctions between the two.
