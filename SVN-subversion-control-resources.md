# SVN (Subversion) 
Subversion (abbreviated SVN) is an open source software versioning and revision control system.  It is a centralized system, meaning the file history is kept on the server.  It is widely used, and has a relatively simple model of usage.  Its goal was to work much like the Concurrent Versions System (CVS), but fix the bugs and missing features of CVS.  Thus, SVN is a compatible successor to CVS
