# SVN (Subversion) 
Subversion (abbreviated SVN) is an open source software versioning and revision control system.  It is a centralized system, meaning the file history is kept on the server.  It is widely used, and has a relatively simple model of usage.  Its goal was to work much like the Concurrent Versions System (CVS), but fix the bugs and missing features of CVS.  Thus, SVN is a compatible successor to CVS

Apache Subversion (often abbreviated SVN, after its command name svn) is a software versioning and revision control system distributed as open source under the Apache License.[2] Software developers use Subversion to maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code, web pages, and documentation. Its goal is to be a mostly compatible successor to the widely used Concurrent Versions System (CVS).

The open source community has used Subversion widely: for example, in projects such as Apache Software Foundation, Free Pascal, FreeBSD, SourceForge, and from 2006 to 2019, GCC. CodePlex was previously a common host for Subversion repositories.

Subversion was created by CollabNet Inc. in 2000, and is now a top-level Apache project being built and used by a global community of contributors.
