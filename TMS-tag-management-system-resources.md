# TMS Tag management system

A tag management system was designed to help manage the lifecycle of digital marketing tags (sometimes referred to as tracking pixels or web beacons), which are used to integrate third-party software into digital properties such as websites and web applications. However, as tag management systems have grown in sophistication they've developed as powerful tools to create rich data in the space between user, their browser and the property. This data can be fed to marketing tools or even used to make dynamic changes to the website or application itself.

Functionality
Digital marketing tags are used to add functionality to web sites, video content, and mobile apps. Such functionality can include web analytics, campaign analytics, audience measurement, personalization, A/B testing, ad servers, behavioral retargeting, and conversion tracking.

The main advantages of a tag management system is that it allows non-developer types to action a multitude of different tasks on a website or application whilst improving performance by reducing written code. It does this by replacing a multitude of tags - historically managed by a developer - with a single container tag which sits across all areas of the property. The tag management system is then accessed separately (normally via a website) to prioritize and "fire" individual tags as appropriate based on business rules, navigation events and known data. Typical functionality includes testing environment (sandboxing), audit trail and version control, ability to A/B test different solutions, tag deduplication, and role-based access to data.

Benefits
Typically cited benefits of tag management systems include:

Agility: Reduced reliance on technical resources and reduced dependency on IT cycles confers greater agility to business users.[1]
Performance: Reduced page load times thanks to asynchronous tag loading, conditional tag loading and tag timeout functionality.
Cost savings: Ability to deduplicate tags used to attribute commission.
Data control: Ability to control data leakage to third-parties and comply with data privacy legislation (cookie consent, do not track).[2] Tag managers also provide another layer of abstraction for managing the complexity of large websites.
Safe preview: Some tag managers, such as Google Tag Manager and Ensighten, include a preview mode which allows checking for formatting and security issues before deploying tags to production.[3][4]

What Is Tag Management?
-----------------------

First off, [what is a tag](https://www.observepoint.com/blog/need-know-web-tags/)?

A tag is a short snippet of code, usually from a third-party vendor, that companies implement on their site to collect data for analytics and digital marketing tools.

Traditionally, marketers and analysts had to submit a ticket to IT every time they wanted to deploy or update a tag, making it harder for data-driven professionals to be agile and measure quickly. Tag management systems (TMSs) make it possible for marketers and analysts to deploy and manage the tags on their site without relying wholly on IT.

Instead of deploying each tag individually, companies can instead deploy a TMS container code and, within a TMS interface, set rules for when any other tags should fire.

What Is a Tag Management Solution?
----------------------------------

A tag management solution or system (TMS) is a platform that allows you to deploy all the tags on your website via a single container tag. Users can define rules/triggers within the TMS’s interface and then based on those rules, the container tag will fire other tags.

Besides being convenient and more organized, a TMS can make your web pages load more quickly by controlling the way your tags load. It can also help you follow [data privacy laws](https://resources.observepoint.com/ebooks/9-point-data-privacy-audit) better by lending some organization to governance practices..

What Does It Mean When a Tag "Fires"?
-------------------------------------

A tag “fires” when its code runs on a web page. With a TMS, employees define when they want a specific tag to fire based on triggers/rules users configure in the TMS interface, 

Examples of triggers include page views, form submissions, a certain amount of time passing, and many others. You can also set tags to fire only within designated times and dates. 

Benefits of Tag Management Solutions
------------------------------------

Some of the benefits of using a tag management system include:

*   Making web pages load faster
*   Letting authorized employees instantly update tags without going through IT
*   Easily tracking a large number of tags—even hundreds
*   Helping you stay compliant with privacy laws
*   Saving money by eliminating duplicate tags
*   Quick testing of different marketing tactics

9 Popular Tag Management Systems
--------------------------------

Each tag management system has its strengths. Below are 10 tag management systems you should consider when preparing to launch a new site or migrate to a new TMS.

1\. Adobe Experience Platform Launch
------------------------------------

Adobe Experience Platform Launch (or Launch for short) replaced Dynamic Tag Management (DTM) a few years ago. When Adobe introduced Launch, they emphasized how its open API architecture would make it easier for vendors and users alike to extend the functionality of the platform. Launch works with both Adobe and non-Adobe products (mainly through the extensive library of extensions powered by the API), but is tightly integrated with the overall Adobe Experience Cloud, so unless you’re planning to adopt Adobe’s product suite, you likely won’t choose Launch.

Feature Highlights:

*   Simple interface for both technical and non-technical users
*   Free to Adobe Experience Cloud customers
*   Marketing-friendly rule builder to determine when to deploy tags and what data to capture
*   Extension catalog to make deploying new tags a quick, user-friendly process

Tag Management and Tag Auditing
-------------------------------

No matter what TMS system an organization ultimately adopts, the larger questions of governance and data quality still exist as companies who have long been busy gathering data try and learn the most effective, strategic and reliable ways to actually leverage that data.

Companies wishing to implement tag management would do well to apply tag governance best practices alongside a TMS, and [website audits](https://www.observepoint.com/blog/website-audit/) (specifically [tag audits](https://resources.observepoint.com/blog/what-is-tag-auditing)) are a key component of a successful tag governance strategy. As you prepare to implement a TMS, use a [sample tag audit](https://www.observepoint.com/request-pages/website-audit) to see what technologies are currently deployed and [start building your tag management strategy](https://www.observepoint.com/blog/building-your-tag-management-plan/).
