# TMS Tag management system

A tag management system was designed to help manage the lifecycle of digital marketing tags (sometimes referred to as tracking pixels or web beacons), which are used to integrate third-party software into digital properties such as websites and web applications. However, as tag management systems have grown in sophistication they've developed as powerful tools to create rich data in the space between user, their browser and the property. This data can be fed to marketing tools or even used to make dynamic changes to the website or application itself.

Functionality
Digital marketing tags are used to add functionality to web sites, video content, and mobile apps. Such functionality can include web analytics, campaign analytics, audience measurement, personalization, A/B testing, ad servers, behavioral retargeting, and conversion tracking.

The main advantages of a tag management system is that it allows non-developer types to action a multitude of different tasks on a website or application whilst improving performance by reducing written code. It does this by replacing a multitude of tags - historically managed by a developer - with a single container tag which sits across all areas of the property. The tag management system is then accessed separately (normally via a website) to prioritize and "fire" individual tags as appropriate based on business rules, navigation events and known data. Typical functionality includes testing environment (sandboxing), audit trail and version control, ability to A/B test different solutions, tag deduplication, and role-based access to data.

Benefits
Typically cited benefits of tag management systems include:

Agility: Reduced reliance on technical resources and reduced dependency on IT cycles confers greater agility to business users.[1]
Performance: Reduced page load times thanks to asynchronous tag loading, conditional tag loading and tag timeout functionality.
Cost savings: Ability to deduplicate tags used to attribute commission.
Data control: Ability to control data leakage to third-parties and comply with data privacy legislation (cookie consent, do not track).[2] Tag managers also provide another layer of abstraction for managing the complexity of large websites.
Safe preview: Some tag managers, such as Google Tag Manager and Ensighten, include a preview mode which allows checking for formatting and security issues before deploying tags to production.[3][4]



 

3\. Google Tag Manager
----------------------

Released in 2012, Google Tag Manager has quickly become one of the most widely used TMS solutions in the market. GTM makes it easy to add and update any Google AdWords tags, Google Analytics tags, DoubleClick Floodlight tags and many non-Google, third-party tags as well, directly from the TMS.

Feature Highlights:

*   Free, easy testing
*   Made for marketers, but IT-friendly
*   Convenient preview mode
*   Multi-account support

You can take a quick introductory tour of Google Tag Manager in this video.

When push comes to shove, I’m a pretty lazy guy. I enjoy nothing more than just to stretch my legs on a couch, pick up my iPad, and read what’s going on in the world. I skip the news, since they’re just full of depressing stories. Instead, I head over to my favorite [Google+](https://plus.google.com) communities to see what’s new in the blogosphere.

 [![Google Tag Manager master and me](https://www.simoahava.com/images/2014/02/suckerfish.jpg#ZgotmplZ)](https://www.simoahava.com/images/2014/02/suckerfish.jpg "Google Tag Manager master and me") 

This approach has led me to some pretty amazing individuals, whom I follow like a suckerfish. These people have written a bunch of great articles, which have helped countless people with their [Google Tag Manager](https://www.google.com/tagmanager) installations. Or they might be really active in the online communities which people turn to for advice.

As you might have noticed, [Google’s own documentation](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/) is often pretty scarce. That’s why so many amazing people do such an incredible job in making the often complicated details behind tag management a bit easier to comprehend.

Without too much further ado, I think the time is ripe to reveal my favorite Google Tag Manager resources, so that you can get on your way to becoming a Grand Tag Master.

I’ve added a short description under each link, along with a difficulty level (my own subjective analysis). The difficulty level has nothing to do with the quality of writing. Rather, I use it to denote how difficult it is to understand the **concept** the article focuses on.

**If you feel like an essential article or individual is missing from these lists, drop me a line with a link and description, and I’ll see if they belong here!**

Follow These People [#](#follow-these-people) ⇧
-----------------------------------------------

First and foremost, here’s my **Follow These People** list. I consider these people to be top contributors in Google Tag Manager related posts. I’ve chosen them partly because I really think that they write a lot of great stuff either in the forums or on their blogs, and partly because they exhibit a quality I enjoy most about a good writer: they don’t brag about themselves or their companies, nor do they exhibit (too much) self-promotion.

Seriously, we’re all taking part in a huge knowledge transfer experiment here. Leave your ego at the door.

And yes, I’m aware that I’ve added myself to the picture of my favorite GTM superstars, and also that I’ve linked to a number of my own posts in the latter sections. I claim the right to do so under editorial privileges :)

Also, don’t forget to visit the [Google Tag Manager community](https://plus.google.com/communities/104865292981489764063) in Google+ on a regular basis. That’s where most of these people hang out.

GTM Extensions [#](#gtm-extensions) ⇧
-------------------------------------

This is where the real meat of GTM is. Since it’s basically run-of-the-mill client-side scripting, you can do some crazy JavaScript magic to collect data in ways you wouldn’t have thought possible. Of course, best practices must be observed, which is why you shouldn’t try your hand at these before understanding the basics of client-side programming and markup languages.
