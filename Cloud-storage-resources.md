 Cloud Storage Systems Overview
------------------------------

Learn More About Cloud Storage Systems

Cloud storage lets users store and sync their data to an online server.

Because they are stored in the cloud rather than on a local drive, files are available on various devices. This allows a person to access files from multiple computers, as well as mobile devices to view, edit, and comment on files. It replaces workarounds like emailing yourself documents. Cloud storage can also act as a backup system for your hard drive.

Cloud storage systems support a variety of file types. Supported files typically include:

*   Text documents
*   Pictures
*   Videos
*   Audio files

The most user-friendly cloud storage systems integrate with other applications for easy edits, playback, and sharing.

Cloud storage is used by individuals to manage personal files, as well as by businesses for file sharing and backup. Some feature sets are very important to businesses but may not be relevant to individuals. Admin and security features, for example, are designed for corporate enterprises where data security and availability are concerns for files stored in the cloud.

#### Pros

*   Sharefile also has a great Outlook Plugin, which we do not use anymore as we standardized our email platform elsewhere, that allows your internal users the ability of sending any file size up to 2GB. It is seamless and does not require user knowledge.
    

#### Cons

*   Their tech support has gone under the umbrella of Citrix's main support line so it takes too long and too much hassle to get to an actual Sharefile support person.

What is Cloud Storage?
----------------------

Cloud storage lets users store and sync their data to an online server.

Because they are stored in the cloud rather than on a local drive, files are available on various devices. This allows a person to access files from multiple computers, as well as mobile devices to view, edit, and comment on files. It replaces workarounds like emailing yourself documents. Cloud storage can also act as a backup system for your hard drive.

Cloud storage systems support a variety of file types. Supported files typically include:

*   Text documents
*   Pictures
*   Videos
*   Audio files

The most user-friendly cloud storage systems integrate with other applications for easy edits, playback, and sharing.

Cloud storage is used by individuals to manage personal files, as well as by businesses for file sharing and backup. Some feature sets are very important to businesses but may not be relevant to individuals. Admin and security features, for example, are designed for corporate enterprises where data security and availability are concerns for files stored in the cloud.

### Cloud Storage Features & Capabilities

#### File Management

These features are core to every cloud storage platform. Typically, file management capabilities include:

*   A search function to easily find files and search within files
*   Device syncing to update files connected to the cloud across devices
*   A web interface, with no install required
*   Support for multiple file types

#### Collaboration

Most cloud storage systems also feature collaboration functionality. Not all tools will have the same level of tracking and control. Collaboration features may include:

*   Notifications when files are changed by others
*   File sharing, with the ability to set editing and view-only permissions
*   Simultaneous editing
*   Change tracking and versioning

#### Security & Administration

Security and administration features are important considerations for enterprises. Security is particularly important for storing sensitive, private data in the cloud.

Cloud storage systems offer different levels of security to address concerns. For example, [Google Cloud Storage](https://www.trustradius.com/products/google-cloud-storage/reviews) lets users set up two-step verification. CertainSafe is HIPAA compliant. [Code42](https://www.trustradius.com/vendors/code42) lets users backup files in the cloud and on another machine. This is so that they are safe and available should something happen to the user’s local drive, even without internet access.

Products like [Box](https://www.trustradius.com/products/box/reviews) and [SpiderOak](https://www.trustradius.com/products/spideroak) support password protected files. Consumer-friendly systems like [Dropbox](https://www.trustradius.com/products/dropbox/reviews) and [Google Drive](https://www.trustradius.com/products/google-drive/reviews) do not.

In addition to protection from outside access, users should consider the system’s security policy. Microsoft reserves the right to scan [OneDrive](https://www.trustradius.com/products/onedrive) user files. Google states it will not access user files on [Google Drive](https://www.trustradius.com/products/google-drive/reviews) unless prompted by law enforcement.

Possible security and administration features include:

*   Single sign-on with Active Directory/SAML based identity software
*   Two-step verification for added security
*   End-user encryption (for integrations)
*   User and role management
*   Control over file access, sharing and editing permissions
*   Storage limits for individual users or groups
*   Choosing where files will be stored, individual users’ storage management
*   Device management, restricting access to certain devices

#### File Sharing

File sharing is one of the most common uses for cloud storage. Most cloud storage software offers a mechanism to let users share files. The level of access, versioning, and change tracking varies by product.

Some cloud storage systems put a cap on file upload size. This is important for anyone looking to upload and share files larger than 2GB.

File sharing is executed in a few different ways:

*   Making users co-owners of files
*   Sending files to users
*   Emailing users a link to the file in the cloud

Cloud storage systems that prioritize availability and make file sharing easy often aren’t as strong on security. The reverse is true as well.

### Cloud Storage Platform Comparison

The platform’s performance, reliability, and integrations are all important considerations for any business use case. Some enterprise cloud storage platforms monitor user activity and storage and offer reporting capabilities for platform administrators. International businesses can also find multilingual and multi-currency capabilities on some platforms. To more easily compare Cloud Storage Systems look for tools that accomplish the following:

**Security**: Don’t take security for granted with cloud storage software, and only store your data with reputable cloud storage providers (who have rock solid reviews, for example). Features you shouldn’t settle on including advanced firewall protection, data encryption, event logging, and threat detection. You also want to make sure that the cloud storage provider you work with provides details into how they manage their data centers and keep them secure.

**Backup & Recovery**: While it’s definitely important to keep your data safe from cyberattacks, 90% of data breaches are [caused by employee error](https://www.techradar.com/news/90-percent-of-data-breaches-are-caused-by-human-error). Some cloud storage systems like Dropbox, for example, offer backup and recovery features for accidentally deleted files. Tools such as file recovery, version history, deletion confirmations, and automated backups are great options that should be on your shortlist of capabilities when looking for a cloud storage system.  
  
**Storage Limits**: While many cloud storage systems have free storage options, there are caps on the amount of storage you can use for free. Free storage options can range from 5GB to 15GB depending on the cloud storage provider, and the types of files you’re storing. If you’re managing the storage of severan users, free options will not provide a high enough storage capacity. However, if each user manages their own cloud storage account, free options can be viable for professional use.

### How does cloud storage work?

Cloud storage works by allowing users to upload data files (e.g. text files, video and audio files, pictures, etc.) and save and store them to an online server. These online servers can either be public or private, but many cloud storage providers use public cloud storage to host users’ data files. Users can then log into the cloud storage from multiple different devices and access their files.

### What are the benefits of using cloud storage?

One of the biggest benefits of using cloud storage is that the user doesn’t have to rely on local storage on their computer or on physical storage (like picture albums). If important files are stored locally on your computer and not to any cloud drive or online location, it can be easy to lose those files if the computer crashes or it’s storage becomes corrupted in some way. In this way, cloud storage can act as a back-up for storage of important data, even if you choose to keep it stored locally as well.

### What is the best cloud storage provider?

According to end-user feedback on TrustRadius, these are the top-rated cloud storage providers:

*   [Google Drive](https://www.trustradius.com/products/google-drive/reviews)
*   [Dropbox Business](https://www.trustradius.com/products/dropbox-business/reviews)
*   [OneDrive](https://www.trustradius.com/products/onedrive/reviews)
*   [Apple iCloud](https://www.trustradius.com/products/apple-icloud/reviews)

### How much does cloud storage cost?

Some cloud storage providers offer a set amount of free storage, which can range from 2GB up to 15GB. DropBox, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive all offer some level of free storage. However, this free storage usually doesn’t include all the functionality that comes with a paid plan.

Paid cloud storage plans can range anywhere from $2 per month up to $100 per month, depending on the number of people who need access to the online storage and how much storage space is available.
