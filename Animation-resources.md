    Good List!
    
    Adobe Character Animator is missing!
    
    This is a great and intuitive tool that allows non-professional animators to create character animations.
    
    I have some free puppets for the software to start experimenting with: [https://www.animationguides.com/](https://www.animationguides.com/) The software is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud and there is also an option to get a free performer mode version that works with premade puppets. I have it all explained on the website.

    Great post with lots of useful tools and resources. I believe Adobe Character Animator should also be listed. It is an Awesome tool that makes it quick and simple to animate 2d characters using motion capture. I have many puppets available on the website (many of them are free) that can be used on the software for a quick start: [https://www.animationguides.com/downloads/category/puppets/](https://www.animationguides.com/downloads/category/puppets/)
