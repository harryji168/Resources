 5 Great Resources That Best Explain MarkLogic
Working with something revolutionary can be both exhilarating — and frustrating as you don’t yet know all that you need to know. You also know that stubbornly refusing to learn it – is only going to put you at the mercy of those who do. After being impressed with the product I recently joined MarkLogic as their newest product marketing manager. I’ve had to do a deep dive in order to learn enough to write about the new features of MarkLogic 9. I thought it might be helpful for other newbies to see this disruptive multi-model database through a newbie’s lens.

MarkLogic is a database management system, what’s wrong with the databases that already existed?
With the technological advances and the ever-changing market today, companies need a foundation that is adaptable and fast. There is a need for organizations to use data in an integrated manner in real time, and databases need to allow seamless use of data out of the box.

In traditional, relational databases, data resides in rows and columns with very little flexibility and context. To add to the problem data today resides in different systems and in different formats. To fulfill a specific data need, organizations need to create a new unified view of the data by creating schemas and using extract, transform, load (ETL) which can be difficult because relational databases are rigid. Not only does this create a new data silo, but makes the data out of date as soon as the integration starts because business needs are always changing.

NoSQL solves a lot of the issues with the rigidity in traditional databases and there’s many NoSQL options so why MarkLogic?
“NoSQL” used to mean a non-traditional database. It later “transmogrified” to mean Not Only SQL. So it became the collection of every type of database that didn’t just require SQL. MarkLogic is not only a NoSQL database, it’s the only enterprise NoSQL database.

This means that it comes with all of the features that traditional databases have—features that enterprises need. This includes ACID transactions, government-grade security, high availability and disaster recovery to keep data safe and performance predictable. In addition, MarkLogic indexes data at ingestion and provides a powerful and quick search engine for data. Other NoSQL options require costly add-ons that continue to pile on until you have a complicated mess before you can use your data.
