# FastAPI

FastAPI is a Web framework for developing RESTful APIs in Python. FastAPI is based on Pydantic and type hints to validate, serialize, and deserialize data, and automatically auto-generate OpenAPI documents.[3]

It fully supports asynchronous programming and can run with Uvicorn and Gunicorn.[4] To improve developer-friendliness, editor support was considered from the earliest days of the project.[5][nb 1]
