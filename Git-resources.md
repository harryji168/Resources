## Git  

Version control is at the heart of any file-based project. Whether you’re a software developer, team member, project manager, student, or anyone working on file-based projects, tracking changes is essential to creating a great product.

In the world of version control, Git leads the way!

What Is Git?
------------

**Git** is one of the most popular open-source **version control systems,** and millions of projects worldwide rely on Git to manage their codebase. It is fast becoming the [standard for version control.](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2015#tech-sourcecontrol) Furthermore, it is a free distributed version control system that allows programmers to track their code changes as different versions of their project.

But what does this really mean? Simply, Git is a system that tracks content. It tracks content by providing a history of all the changes made by developers to the code within the various files of a project. Every time changes are made to a project and it is saved, Git creates what is known as a _commit_. A commit represents the state of all files in a project at a specific point in time.

Git is a distributed version control system that enables a team of developers to collaboratively work on a single project; a copy of the project is available on all the developers’ personal computers. You can host projects on your computer, a private server, or an open-source website, such as [GitHub,](https://github.com/) because they all mirror entire repositories and change histories. **Git** is the version control system, and **GitHub** is basically cloud storage for managing Git repositories.

How does Git work?
------------------

As explained, Git allows you to save your code and track all the changes you make. Typically, when using Git, your code moves through three locations, known as the **working directory, staging area, and repository:**

*   The **working directory** is where you do all your work like editing, creating, organizing, and deleting files;
*   The **staging area** is where you can track any changes you made in the working directory; and
*   The **repository** is where Git permanently stores changes that you made. Each **commit** to this repository is considered a version.

Benefits of Git
---------------

1.  All processes are **atomic.** This means that Git processes a set of changes as a single operation.
2.  Git allows developers to maintain a large number of separate code branches. Creating, deleting, and merging these branches is transparent and fast.
3.  Another excellent feature of Git is that it uses a data model to ensure encryption integrity for everything in the repository. This is not possible in other version control systems.
4.  Because Git is becoming the standard for version control it’s integrated into most IDE’s, such as Intelli J, Visual Studio, Code and Atom to name a few!
5.  Strong community support: The Git community is very large and very helpful.
6.  Git saves your code to the cloud, therefore serving as a backup of your local copy.

Now that you have some background information on Git and its excellent features, let’s look at the seven best Git tutorials to get you up and running quickly.

The 7 Best Git Tutorials
------------------------

Below is a list of various Git tutorials for those of all skill levels. It doesn’t matter where you are in your career, there are always new things to learn or ways to simply refresh your knowledge. Each of these tutorials offers a unique way of learning Git.

Start with these and if you need further learning I suggest you take a look at this awesome [Git & GitHub Boot Camp.](https://www.cprime.com/learning/courses/git-github-boot-camp/)

This tutorial teaches you how to:

*   Create a Git repository
*   View versions of a project
*   Understand history using commits
*   Manipulate branches

Further Learning
----------------

There is no excuse to avoid Git; sooner or later, you’ll need Git for your project, so it’s better to start learning now. However, true mastery requires a lot of practice and in-depth training. Although the tutorials mentioned in this post will not give you everything you need to know about Git, they offer an excellent way to learn some of the nitty-gritty of Git and its purposes.

Nevertheless, if you need a more comprehensive approach to Git without prior knowledge or experience, take a look at this [Git & GitHub Boot Camp here](https://www.cprime.com/learning/courses/git-github-boot-camp/). It’s a two-day class that gives you insight and hands-on experience with Git and related version control concepts.

First the course instructs you on implementing basic and advanced Git commands. Second, it teaches best practices for using GitHub as a platform for collaborative code development. Above all, by the end of this course, you’ll know how to manage large-scale projects using Git and GitHub.

### Get Started with Git

You can get by most of your life without Git, until suddenly you have to write code with three other people, or worse, have to one day start maintaining Amy's computer vision codebase after she leaves the company to become a CTO. Then you have half a day to become an expert in this quirky little version control tool. Not to worry. These teachers have you covered.

 [![XKCD cartoon](images/git/git.png "If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git. Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything.")](
        https://xkcd.com/1597/
        ) 

I asked my friends and colleagues on [LinkedIn](
          https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brohrer_if-a-beginner-wanted-to-learn-how-to-use-activity-6581471551160414208-tx0K
          ) and [Twitter](
          https://twitter.com/_brohrer_/status/1175706016987701248?s=20
          ) if the knew of any Git tutorials they would recommend. I was overwhelmed by the response. There are a lot to choose from. However, a few rose to the top as being both very popular and exceptionally well suited for someone just starting out. But for every resource listed here, there are five others in the threads, most of them very good.

Several of the resources here reference [GitHub](https://github.com/), a popular online server and host for git-managed projects. Another very similar serivce is [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/). Most of the tutorial references on GitHub can be applied to GitLab with only minor modifications. If you decide you want to migrate a project from GitHub to GitLab, [here is a step-by-step guide](
                https://e2eml.school/gitlab_import.html
          ).

        ) 

This is an excellent all around introduction to Git at the command line. It stays practical, with brief forays into the underlying mechanisms where necessary. The video format provides extra momentum.

[### Pro Git, written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub

          https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
        ) 

Of you prefer a book format, Pro Git is an excellent way to go. Hosted on the Git website, it enjoys the blessing of an an official resource. It is comprehensive and well put together.

        ) 

If you happen to be an R user, you will never find a better resource than this. Practical, cheeky, brilliantly organized, it is a tour de force of instructional writing. Note that this guide covers both Git and GitHub, two distinct, but tightly interrelated tools.

Even if you're not an R user, I highly recommend a look through the accompanying manifesto: [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](
            https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/
          )
