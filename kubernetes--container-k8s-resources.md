# Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
 an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management.[5][6] Google originally designed Kubernetes, but the Cloud Native Computing Foundation now maintains the project.

Kubernetes works with Docker, Containerd, and CRI-O.[7] Originally, it interfaced exclusively with the Docker runtime[8] through a "Dockershim"; however, since 2016, Kubernetes has deprecated the shim in favor of directly interfacing with the container through Containerd, or replacing Docker with a runtime that is compliant with the Container Runtime Interface (CRI).[9][10][11]

Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat and VMware offer Kubernetes-based platforms or infrastructure as a services (IaaS) that deploy Kubernetes.[12][13]
