 # FCM Firebase Cloud Messaging

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), formerly known as Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), is a cross-platform cloud solution for messages and notifications for Android, iOS, and web applications, which as of 2021 can be used at no cost.[1] Firebase Cloud Messaging allows third-party application developers to send notifications or messages from servers hosted by FCM to users of the platform or end users.

The service is provided by Firebase, a subsidiary of Google. On October 21, 2014, Firebase announced it had been acquired by Google for an undisclosed amount.[2] The official Google Cloud Messaging website points to Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) as the new version of GCM.[3] Firebase is a mobile platform which supports users in developing mobile and web applications. Firebase Cloud Messaging is one of many products which are part of the Firebase platform. On the platform users can integrate and combine different Firebase features in both web and mobile applications.
