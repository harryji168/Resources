# SharePoint

SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office. Launched in 2001, SharePoint is primarily sold as a document management and storage system, but the product is highly configurable and its usage varies substantially among organizations. 

Your company’s intranet can help spark employee engagement, multi-level collaborations and community, and boost productivity and belief in the organization’s culture and policies.

It can’t just be another workplace platform. It needs to reflect the company’s personality, purpose, and values. It has to make communication more effective, improve processes, organize assets, and support your employees’ work.

Most intranet solutions just don’t cut it, which is why a majority of companies tend to choose SharePoint intranet when developing corporate portals. No matter what type of business you’re engaged in or what your goals for a workplace platform are, SharePoint intranet can be designed to suit your particular needs.

However, it can be hard to come up with a design for your SharePoint intranet site from scratch. You might not know what kind of features to include, what the layout should look like, or how many functionalities to cram into it.
