 # Magento
  
 Magento is an open-source e-commerce platform written in PHP. It uses multiple other PHP frameworks such as Laminas and Symfony. Magento source code is distributed under Open Software License (OSL) v3.0. Magento was acquired by Adobe Inc in May 2018 for $1.68 billion.[2]

The software was originally developed by Varien Inc., a US private company headquartered in Culver City, California, with assistance from volunteers.

More than 100,000 online stores have been created on this platform. The platform code has been downloaded more than 2.5 million times, and $155 billion worth of goods have been sold through Magento-based systems in 2019.[3] Two years ago, Magento accounted for about 30% of the total market share.

Varien published the first general-availability release of the software on March 31, 2008. Roy Rubin, the former CEO of Varien, later sold a share of the company to eBay, which eventually completely acquired and then sold the company to Permira;[4] Permira later sold it to Adobe.[5]

On November 17, 2015, Magento 2.0 was released. Among the features changed in V2 were:

reduced table locking issues
improved page caching
enterprise-grade scalability
inbuilt rich snippets for structured data
new file structure with easier customization
CSS Preprocessing using LESS & CSS URL resolver
improved performance
better structured code base
Magento employs the MySQL or MariaDB relational database management system, the PHP programming language, and elements of the Zend Framework.[6] It applies the conventions of object-oriented programming and model–view–controller architecture. Magento also uses the entity–attribute–value model to store data[7] and as of version 2.4 it requires Elasticsearch for its catalog search capability.[8] On top of that, Magento 2 introduced the Model-View-ViewModel pattern to its front-end code using the JavaScript library Knockout.js.
