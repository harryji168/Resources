# Kotlin
 

 Kotlin is a very well-known programming language, especially for Android apps development. Kotlin is the language that can interoperate with Java. It indicates that you can use this programming language within already built applications in Java.

Kotlin Features
Java Interoperability — Java is the most widely used programming language for Android applications. If you have learned Kotlin and got a project half-built in Java, you can use Kotlin within Java to extend the functionalities of that application.

Extension Functions — Kotlin allows the developers to add extensions to the classes without modifying the source code. Programmers can add their own functionalities in the classes easily, which can help them code the application easily and effectively.

Efficiency — The efficiency of this programming is relatively high as compared to other programming languages. You can write complex programs that will be executed in less time, which increases the reliability of app usage.

Kotlin Limitations
Kotlin is a new programming language, so there are fewer developers available for this language. If you got your app developed in Kotlin, then you want to change developer, you might not find a new developer because of the small developers’ community.
It is also hard to fix issues with Kotlin.
